# Grove_BBG
This repo contains Python files for using the beaglebone green with various grove modules.
Many of the files in this repository are broken or not fully working.

## Attribution
The BBG ships with half-working python demos for many sensors, thanks
to the work of the Seeed studios team. Copies of these demos are available
from https://github.com/lanselambor/Grove_BBG, and this repo is
a fork of that. This fork fixes some of the demos which previously
did not work, but many of the python scripts are still broken. The main
purpose of this fork is to provide easy access to Seeed's Python example
code, not active development.

This repository is not part of the modular CAT system, but is kept for
reference on how to use Grove modules in Python.
