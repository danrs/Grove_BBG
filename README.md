# Grove_BBG
This repo contains Python files for using th beaglebone green with various grove modules.

## Attribution
The BBG ships with half-working python demos for many sensors, thanks
to the work of the Seeed studios team. This repo is forked from
https://github.com/lanselambor/Grove_BBG,
which holds copies of those demos. This fork fixes up some of the demos
which previously did not work.
